CRITICAL INVESTOR INTEREST LOGIC (GATING VARIABLE):
The "Investor Interest / Ability to Raise Capital" score is NOT a soft modifier - it's a critical feasibility gate that can override positive financial metrics:

CONDITIONAL INVESTMENT RULES:
- IF Investor Interest ‚â§ 2 AND Additional Investment Requested > $3M:
  * Apply "All-or-Nothing" threshold logic - high risk of stranded capital
  * Consider "Conditional Investment" recommendations (e.g., "Invest $2M only if remaining $8M committed by others within 30 days")
  * Flag "bagholder risk" - we bear disproportionate risk without syndicate support
  * Question: Is our capital catalytic or just hopeful?

- IF Investor Interest = 1 (only us interested):
  * HEAVILY downweight confidence regardless of financial metrics
  * Add "syndicate risk" and "round fragility" to keyRisks
  * Suggest: "Wait for lead investor confirmation" or "Seek co-investors before committing"
  * If use-of-funds is binary (needs full amount), flag as "round unlikely to close"

- IF Investor Interest = 4-5 (competitive/oversubscribed):
  * Increase confidence and support partial commitments
  * Consider rightsizing participation: "Partial participation sufficient in competitive round"
  * Lower urgency to overcommit capital

ROUND FEASIBILITY ASSESSMENT:
- Evaluate if the capital need is modular vs binary (can company succeed with partial funding?)
- If binary funding need + low investor interest = flag as "round fragility risk"
- Apply minimum raise success likelihood: "Would this raise succeed without our anchor?"

PROJECTED REVENUE GROWTH INTEGRATION LOGIC:
The "Projected Revenue Growth (Next 12 Months)" is a critical forward-looking momentum signal that must be weighted against external validation signals:

GROWTH MOMENTUM INTERPRETATION:
- Above 100% = Hyper-growth stage signal (justify larger follow-ons if externally validated)
- Above 50% = Strong forward momentum (positive indicator if supported by market interest)
- Below 25% = Caution flag unless paired with profitability or defensibility
- Must be cross-referenced with TTM performance for credibility assessment

CREDIBILITY VALIDATION RULES:
- High projected growth (>50%) + High investor interest (4-5) = Validate optimistic projections and consider increased investment
- High projected growth (>100%) + Low investor interest (1-2) = RED FLAG - aggressive projections lack external validation, downweight confidence significantly
- Low projected growth (<25%) + High burn multiple = Flag capital efficiency concerns and execution risk

CAPITAL RECOMMENDATION INTEGRATION:
- Use projected growth to justify investment sizing: strong validated growth can support larger commitments
- Flag disconnects: if projections are ambitious but investor interest is low, question if growth targets are realistic
- Consider runway needs: aggressive growth projections require adequate execution timeline and capital efficiency

VALUATION-BASED DECISION FRAMEWORK:
The Pre-Money and Post-Money Valuation data must drive sophisticated capital deployment decisions:

OWNERSHIP & DILUTION ANALYSIS:
- Calculate ownership preservation: Compare current equity stake vs. new round dilution impact
- Assess return compression: Determine required exit valuation for 3x+ returns on new capital at post-money pricing
- Flag overpricing: If markup exceeds growth fundamentals (revenue, market traction), caution against follow-on participation

VALUATION JUSTIFICATION RULES:
- High markup (>2.5x from implied previous round) + Strong growth (>50% TTM + >50% projected) + High investor interest (4-5) = Validate premium pricing
- High markup (>3x) + Weak growth (<25% TTM or projected) + Low investor interest (1-2) = RED FLAG for overpricing, recommend decline
- Reasonable markup (<2x) + Moderate growth + Competitive interest = Support pro-rata or increased participation

STRATEGIC ROUND ANALYSIS:
- Higher post-money valuations create greater exit pressure and strategic risk
- Low-quality rounds at inflated valuations should reduce confidence and flag "deadweight pricing" risk
- Consider if valuation is hype-driven vs. fundamentals-driven based on growth metrics and market validation

RETURN COMPRESSION MATH:
- Calculate new cost basis at post-money valuation
- Determine minimum exit valuation needed for acceptable returns (3x+ target)
- If exit requirements seem unrealistic given TAM and market conditions, flag as overpriced participation

ROUND COMPLEXITY DECISION FRAMEWORK:
The Round Complexity score (1-5) is a critical structural risk factor that directly impacts investment confidence:

COMPLEXITY INTERPRETATION:
- Score 5: Clean, investor-friendly terms with simple preferred equity structure
- Score 4: Standard terms with minor complexities but acceptable structure
- Score 3: Moderate complexity requiring careful review but not prohibitive
- Score 2: High complexity with potentially problematic terms (cram-downs, stacked preferences)
- Score 1: Extremely messy structure with major red flags and governance risks

DECISION IMPACT RULES:
- Complexity 1-2 + Large Investment (>$3M): Flag "structural risk" and reduce confidence regardless of metrics
- Complexity 1-2 + Any request: Require legal review and consider conditional investment only
- Complexity 3: Standard evaluation with yellow flag for term review
- Complexity 4-5: Support streamlined follow-on process with increased confidence
- Missing complexity: Default to 3 but flag need for legal/term review

CONFIDENCE MODIFICATION:
- Complexity 1-2: Cap confidence at 3 maximum, regardless of financial performance
- Complexity 3: No confidence penalty but mention term review requirement
- Complexity 4-5: Potential confidence boost when combined with strong metrics

  `TIMELINE-BASED ANALYSIS MODE:
Use the 5-point revenue timeline for comprehensive trajectory assessment. Apply these decision rules:

1. GROWTH TREND EVALUATION:
- Compare Year -2 ‚Üí -1 ‚Üí Current ‚Üí +1 ‚Üí +2 progression
- Label as "Accelerating", "Stagnating", or "Volatile" based on pattern
- Validate that projections (+1, +2) are realistic given historical performance

2. CREDIBILITY VALIDATION:
- If Forward CAGR > 2x Historical CAGR: Flag "projection credibility risk"
- If High projected growth + Low investor interest: RED FLAG for overoptimistic projections
- If Flat historical growth + Aggressive projections: Question execution capability

3. EXIT VALUE MODELING:
- Use Year +2 Revenue for exit calculations: Projected Exit Value = Revenue+2 √ó Industry Multiple
- Factor timeline into IRR: ${company.exitTimeline || 3} years to exit affects risk-adjusted returns
- If Forward Revenue Multiple > 30x: Flag "valuation requires high exit premium"

4. TRAJECTORY SCORE INTEGRATION:
- Trajectory Score ${company.revenueTrajectoryScore !== null ? `(${company.revenueTrajectoryScore}/5)` : '(not calculated)'} reflects growth consistency and credibility
- Scores ‚â§2: High execution risk, reduce confidence
- Scores ‚â•4: Strong momentum, support increased investment` :

LIMITATION: Without timeline data, projections will have lower confidence scores due to inability to validate growth patterns.`
}

${externalResearch}

EXIT TIMELINE INTEGRATION PROTOCOL:
Use the Exit Timeline to drive financial projections and time-sensitive investment decisions:

PROJECTED FINANCIAL CALCULATIONS:
- IF ARR PROVIDED: Projected ARR at Exit = Current ARR √ó (1 + Revenue Growth Rate) ^ Exit Timeline
- IF REVENUE PROVIDED: Projected Revenue at Exit = Current Revenue √ó (1 + Revenue Growth Rate) ^ Exit Timeline  
- Gross Exit Value = Projected ARR √ó Industry EV/ARR Multiple OR Projected Revenue √ó Industry EV/Revenue Multiple (from external research)
- Factor timeline into IRR calculations: longer timelines increase risk and may compress returns
- SPECIFY which metric (ARR vs Revenue) is being used in all exit value calculations

REQUIRED OUTPUT FORMAT FOR EXIT VALUE CALCULATIONS:
You MUST show explicit calculations in your projectedExitValueRange and riskAdjustedMonetizationSummary responses:

FORMAT EXAMPLE:
"Current ARR: $5.0M | Projected ARR (3 years, 80% growth): $5.0M √ó (1.8)¬≥ = $29.2M | Industry Multiple: 12x EV/ARR (based on MosaicML 12x, Databricks 10-15x range) | Gross Exit Value: $29.2M √ó 12x = $350M | Risk-Adjusted (70% success): $245M"

OR for Revenue-based:
"Current Revenue: $8.0M | Projected Revenue (3 years, 60% growth): $8.0M √ó (1.6)¬≥ = $32.8M | Industry Multiple: 8x EV/Revenue (based on Figma 8x, Canva 6-10x range) | Gross Exit Value: $32.8M √ó 8x = $262M | Risk-Adjusted (80% success): $210M"

TIME-SENSITIVE RISK ASSESSMENT:
- Longer timelines (>5 years) increase execution risk and market uncertainty
- Factor capital lock-up risk into confidence scoring
- Consider timeline feasibility vs. runway and burn rate
- Assess whether timeline aligns with typical sector exit patterns

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
1. Base capital recommendation primarily on financial metrics above, enhanced by exit timeline projections
2. Use exit timeline for ALL projected financial calculations (ARR, exit value, IRR assessment)
3. Include explicit timeline mentions in reasoning: "based on a ${company.exitTimeline || 3}-year projected exit timeline"
4. Factor timeline into confidence scoring: realistic timelines boost confidence, aggressive timelines reduce it
5. Use external market context to validate timeline assumptions and sector exit patterns
6. If external data contradicts timeline assumptions, explain discrepancy and adjust projections
7. EXPLICITLY CITE external sources when they influence timeline or exit value projections
8. MANDATORY: Factor investor interest level into capital recommendation, confidence score, and suggested actions:
   - Score 1 (only us interested): Higher risk but potential leverage - scrutinize downside carefully
   - Score 2-3 (moderate interest): Standard evaluation based on performance metrics
   - Score 4-5 (oversubscribed/competitive): Consider rightsizing participation, less urgency to overcommit
9. MANDATORY: Factor round complexity into all decisions:
   - Complexity 1-2: Reduce confidence, require legal review, consider declining or conditional investment
   - Complexity 3: Standard evaluation with term review requirement
   - Complexity 4-5: Support increased participation with clean structure confidence boost
10. MANDATORY: Use exit timeline in all commentary sections (reasoning, projectedExitValueRange, suggestedAction)

RISK-ADJUSTED MONETIZATION SUMMARY PROTOCOL:
You MUST calculate the Risk-Adjusted Monetization Summary using this 7-step process:

STEP 1: Project ARR at Exit
Projected ARR at Exit = ARR (TTM) √ó (1 + Projected Revenue Growth) ^ Exit Timeline
- Use company revenue/ARR data and projected growth rate
- Use Exit Timeline from user input; if blank, default to 3 years

STEP 2: Pull Industry-Appropriate Multiple from External Research
- Use the Multiple Type (${research?.structuredInsights?.multipleType || 'EV/Revenue'}) identified in external research
- Extract ${research?.structuredInsights?.multipleType || 'EV/Revenue'} multiples from external research data and named comparables
- For ${company.industry || 'this industry'}: Use industry-specific multiples based on business model
- Cite specific comparables when available: ${research?.structuredInsights?.namedComps?.length > 0 ? 
    research.structuredInsights.namedComps.map(c => `${c.company} (${c.multiple})`).join(', ') : 
    'Use general industry benchmarks if no specific comps available'}

STEP 3: Estimate Gross Exit Value
Gross Exit Value = Projected ${research?.structuredInsights?.multipleType?.includes('ARR') ? 'ARR' : 'Revenue'} at Exit √ó Industry ${research?.structuredInsights?.multipleType || 'EV/Revenue'} Multiple

STEP 4: Assign Composite Success Probability
Calculate risk-weighted probability based on:
- Execution Risk: Burn Multiple, Runway, EBITDA Margin, Revenue Growth
- Market Risk: TAM, Exit Activity in Sector, Barrier to Entry  
- Cap Table Risk: Round Complexity, Investor Interest
Risk Levels: Low (50-70%), Medium (20-40%), High (5-15%)

STEP 5: Calculate Risk-Adjusted Exit
Risk-Adjusted Exit = Gross Exit Value √ó Success Probability

STEP 6: Estimate VC Return  
VC Return = Risk-Adjusted Exit √ó Equity Stake %

STEP 7: Risk-Adjusted MOIC
MOIC = VC Return √∑ (Total Investment + Additional Investment Requested)
