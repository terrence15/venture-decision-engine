  const prompt = `You are an expert venture capital investor evaluating whether to approve an additional capital request from a portfolio company. Your analysis must be grounded in the Excel financial data with external market insights used only as supporting context.

ANALYSIS PROTOCOL:
- Excel financial data is the PRIMARY source of truth for all investment decisions
- External research provides market color and sector context ONLY  
- Never hallucinate or invent market data not provided in external research
- If external data is insufficient, state this explicitly rather than making assumptions
- Integrate approved source insights into reasoning and risk assessment where available

PRIMARY FINANCIAL DATA (REQUIRED BASIS FOR DECISIONS):
Company: ${company.companyName}
Industry: ${company.industry || 'Not specified'}
Total Investment to Date: $${(company.totalInvestment / 1000000).toFixed(1)}M
Equity Stake: ${company.equityStake}%
Current MOIC: ${company.moic}x
TTM Revenue Growth: ${company.revenueGrowth}%
Burn Multiple: ${company.burnMultiple}x
Runway: ${company.runway} months
TAM Score: ${company.tam}/5
Exit Activity in Sector: ${company.exitActivity}
Barrier to Entry: ${company.barrierToEntry}/5
Additional Investment Requested: $${(company.additionalInvestmentRequested / 1000000).toFixed(1)}M
Investor Interest / Ability to Raise Capital: ${company.investorInterest || 'Not specified'}/5

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
1. Base capital recommendation primarily on financial metrics above
2. Use external market context to enhance reasoning and risk assessment where available
3. If external data contradicts financial performance, explain discrepancy and prioritize actual company data
4. EXPLICITLY CITE external sources when they influence your decision (use format: "per [Source]")
5. Clearly distinguish between data-driven insights and market-context observations
6. If insufficient external data, acknowledge this limitation explicitly
7. MANDATORY: Factor investor interest level into capital recommendation, confidence score, and suggested actions:
   - Score 1 (only us interested): Higher risk but potential leverage - scrutinize downside carefully
   - Score 2-3 (moderate interest): Standard evaluation based on performance metrics
   - Score 4-5 (oversubscribed/competitive): Consider rightsizing participation, less urgency to overcommit

Provide your analysis in the following JSON format:
{
  "recommendation": "Specific capital amount decision based on financial performance (e.g., 'Invest $250K of $1M request', 'Decline', 'Bridge Capital Only - $500K')",
  "timingBucket": "One of: Double Down, Reinvest (3-12 Months), Hold (3-6 Months), Bridge Capital Only, Exit Opportunistically, Decline",
  "reasoning": "2-4 sentences starting with financial analysis, incorporating relevant external market context WITH EXPLICIT SOURCE CITATIONS when external data influences decision, and concluding with investment logic",
  "confidence": "Integer 1-5 where 5=strong financial+external validation+high investor interest, 3=solid financial metrics, 1=insufficient data or concerning metrics with low interest",
  "keyRisks": "1-2 sentences highlighting material threats based on financial data and available market conditions WITH SOURCE CITATIONS where relevant", 
  "suggestedAction": "1 tactical sentence with specific next step incorporating both performance and market timing",
